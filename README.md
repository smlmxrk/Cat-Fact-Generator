## Features

* Display a random cat fact
* Fetch multiple cat facts on demand
* Responsive, mobile-friendly design

## Prerequisites

No build tools or frameworks required. A modern web browser is sufficient.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/smlmxrk/Cat-Fact-Generator
cd random-cat-facts
```

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. The page will fetch and display a random cat fact.
3. Click the "Load More" button to fetch additional facts.

Alternatively, serve the folder with a static server:

```bash
# Install http-server globally (optional)
npm install -g http-server

# Serve the directory
http-server .
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or the port whatever port it's beinig hosted on) in your browser.

## Configuration

By default, the app fetches one fact per request. In the future, I plan on adding functionality to retrieve several facts in one click!

This project uses the [Cat Facts API](https://catfact.ninja).

* **GET** `/fact`
  Returns a single random cat fact.
* **GET** `/facts?limit=<number>`
